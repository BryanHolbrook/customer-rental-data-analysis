Customer Rental Data Analysis

## DVD rental dataset used to answer the following business question — “How many rentals per month per person is needed to reach a 50% increase in rentals per customer?” in a 30 day period.

By showing stakeholders how often our customers rent movies in a 30-day period and how many more rentals are needed per person to increase rentals by 50% per customer to reach an increase in revenue by 50% month-over-month. Goal, identify the highest renting customers, and increase pointed marketing to encourage repeat rentals from an interested customer base. Then increase custom-targeted marketing with our least active customers to promote new and unique rentals through tailored digital ads.


The data needed to achieve these business goals will be aggregated and joined from three separate tables. The names of the tables being joined from the DVD data set for our reports are the ‘rental’, ‘customer’, and ‘address’ tables. Transformations from these tables will be provided in the form of two separate reports—a Detailed Report for the marketing team and a Summary Report for the business stakeholders.
